# This is a program which randomly chooses a number to guess and then

# In each wrong attempt, the computer will give a hint that the number
# is greater or smaller than the one you have guessed.
# The user can choose the difficult of the game: this choise
# change the range of the number randomly generated and the
# number of attempts.
